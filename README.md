# DICE PROJECT

I have used vite and react to create this simple application. This exercise practices working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React. There is a die component and a rolldice component. Dice will shake and get a random number between 1 and 6, when clicked on the button. Check your luck!

## Demo

The app is live at:
